## What's Different

| Sentiment | String labels | Numeric -1.0 to 1.0 + trend |
| Data sources | yfinance only | Polaris (primary) + yfinance (supplementary) |
| NLP screener | N/A | Natural language → analysis |
| Evidence weighting | Equal | Confidence-weighted debate |
| Executive summary | Buried | First section, 10-second answer |
| Macro analysis | None | Economy, yields, VIX, sector rotation |

## Safety & Accuracy Improvements

TradingAgents-Pro includes several safety enhancements not present in the original framework:

| Risk | Original | TradingAgents-Pro |
|------|----------|-------------------|
| **LLM hallucination** | No safeguards — agents can fabricate numbers, prices, and claims | Every agent includes `[TradingAgents-Pro Enhancement]` accuracy directives: never fabricate, report N/A for missing data, attribute every number |
| **Unverified claims** | All claims treated as equally valid | Fact Checker agent verifies claims against source corpus before debate — verified claims carry more weight |
| **Source bias** | No assessment of source diversity or framing | Bias Auditor agent flags skewed source distribution, framing divergences, and blind spots |
| **Data contradictions** | Not detected | Contradiction Detector catches conflicting facts across analyst reports, rates severity |
| **Confidence transparency** | No data quality signal | Confidence Dashboard shows sources consulted, verification rate, contradiction count, bias assessment |
| **Missing data handling** | Agents may guess or omit silently | Agents explicitly state "Data unavailable" — gaps are visible, not hidden |

All safety enhancements are tagged in the source code with `[TradingAgents-Pro Enhancement]` so they're easy to identify in diffs against the original.

→ Fundamentals Analyst (financials + earnings + SEC filings)
→ Fact Checker (verifies claims BEFORE debate)
→ Bull Advocate ↔ Bear Advocate (evidence-weighted debate)
→ Bias Auditor (source distribution + framing analysis)
→ Forecast Agent (predictions + invalidation criteria)
→ Contradiction Detector (flags conflicting facts)
→ Research Evaluator (evidence-weighted scoring)
→ Trader (executive summary + confidence dashboard)
→ Risk Analysts (aggressive/conservative/neutral with macro + invalidation)
→ Portfolio Manager (final decision with full evidence trail)
```

## Sample Output

See [examples/NVDA_pro.md](examples/NVDA_pro.md) for a complete analysis report, and [examples/NVDA_original.md](examples/NVDA_original.md) for the same ticker analyzed by the original TradingAgents framework.

### Executive Summary (from a real run)

```
## Executive Summary
Verdict: BUY | Confidence: 78% | Top Risk: China export restrictions
Data Quality: 0.84 avg confidence | 23 sources | balanced bias

Verified Claims: 7/8 supported | 1 disputed
Contradictions: 1 (minor — layoff count discrepancy)
Macro: FAVORABLE (low VIX, strong GDP, sector rotation into tech)
```

## Configuration

```python
from tradingagents.graph.trading_graph import TradingAgentsGraph

config["deep_think_llm"] = "claude-sonnet-4-20250514"

# Debate rounds
config["max_debate_rounds"] = 2      # More rounds = deeper analysis
config["max_risk_discuss_rounds"] = 2

ta = TradingAgentsGraph(config=config)
state, decision = ta.propagate("NVDA", "2026-03-24")
