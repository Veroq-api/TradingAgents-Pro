"""
Contradiction Detector — scans all reports for conflicting facts.

This is an LLM-only agent (no API calls).  It gathers every report produced so
far and asks the LLM to identify conflicting statements, inconsistent data, and
single-source claims that lack corroboration.

Runs AFTER the Forecast Agent and BEFORE the Research Manager, so the manager
can weigh data-consistency when making the final recommendation.
