Forecast Agent — generates forward-looking predictions with invalidation criteria.

Calls the Polaris ``client.forecast()`` endpoint for external forecast data,
then synthesizes it with all prior analysis to produce structured predictions,
signals to watch, wildcards, and specific invalidation criteria.

Runs AFTER the Bias Auditor and BEFORE the Contradiction Detector.
